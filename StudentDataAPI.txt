1.I used a list I created when the get request is called
as the exercise doesn't mention making use of a database

2. When doing insert(POST) and Update(PUT) on POSTMAN OR Advanced Rest Client,
 ensure Body Content Type="application/json".

3.The list is displayed after each post,put or delete to show the updated list.

4.when using get(), the list is regenarated because the list is created on the get request.
I didn't use a database but a list.
